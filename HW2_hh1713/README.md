## Assignment 1
Took me a long time to figure out how to correctly fetch data from the url
Worked my way through the jason data using keys and list indices until the desired data was found.

Kristi Korsberg gave me some help getting the syntax right for the iteration of the data.

Worked with Nicola Macchitella and Achilles Saxby on this assignment.

## Assignment 2
Felipe Gonzalez help me understand the writing to csv syntax.

For some reason I could no create a breviation of my code in the second assignment (wouldn't run):

    busData = data['Siri']['ServiceDelivery']['VehicleMonitoringDelivery'][0]['VehicleActivity']
    
so the iteration is really messy.

Worked with Nicola Macchitella and Achilles Saxby on this assignment.

## Assignment 3
Finding a csv dataset took a long time. Jonathan Pichot taught me how to search for csv files in the bash shell.

As I was plotting the figure I had trouble rendering it, that is a lot of the plots I requested were no rendered.
This mainly happened when I tried to plot together things I thought to be remotely interesting.
My guess is that the numerical datasets I was trying to use were incomplete or crooked.
In the end I plotted the height of existing buildings against block numbers.

To set up the data in pandas I used the notes from the previous PUI lecture.
